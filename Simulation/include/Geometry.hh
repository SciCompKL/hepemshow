 *
 * @brief Geometry description for this simple simulation setup.
 *
 * The simulation setup is a **configurable simplified sampling calorimeter** built
 * up from `N` layers of an `absorber` and a `gap` (both by default). The number of
 * layers `N`, the thickness of both the `absorber` and `gap` along the x-axes
 * can be set and changed dynamically.
 *
 * - `layer`:
 *   - number   :   `fNumLayers`
 *   - set/get  :   `SetNumLayers(int)`/`GetNumLayers()`
 *   - thickness:   `fLayerThick` (calculated automatically from the `absorber`
 *                   and `gap` thicknesses)
 *
 * - `absorber`:
 *   - thickness:   `fAbsThick`
 *   - set/get  :   `SetAbsThick(G4double)`/`GetAbsThick()`
 *   - material :   lead tungstate/atolzite (`"G4_PbWO4"`) with material `index = 1` (by default)
 *
 * - `gap`:
 *   - thickness:   `fGapThick`
 *   - set/get  :   `SetGapThick(G4double)`/`GetGapThick()`
 *   - material :   liquid argon (`"G4_lAr"`) with material `index = 2` (by default)
 *
 * @note The default length unit is [mm] so all thicknesses and sizes are
 * assumed to be give in [mm] units.
 *
 * @note The `gap` thickness can be set even to zero in which case the
 * `calorimeter` is built up from the given number of `layer`s of `absorber`
 * with the given thickness (i.e. a single material calorimeter sliced by the
 * `layer`s).
 *
 * @note The material indices are determined by the order of the corresponding
 * `Geant4` (predefined NIST) material names listed in the material name vector of
 * the data extraction application (i.e. in `DataGeneration.cc`). This application
 * is used beforehand to extract the material (and cuts) dependent data required
 * during the simulation. The default vector in `DataGeneration.cc`, that was used
 * to extract the provided data files, is
 *
 *     // list of Geant4 (NIST) material names
 *     std::vector<std::string> matList {"G4_Galactic", "G4_PbWO4", "G4_lAr"};
 *
 * hence the above `material - index` mapping.
 * Changing the material name(s) in this above vector (especially at index `1`
 * and/or `2` as the vacuum is always needed to fill the container volumes like
 * the `layer`, `calorimeter` or the `world` volumes),
 * regenerating the data, then executing the same `Simulation` application,
 * corresponds to changing the mateiral (with the given index) in the simulation.
 * A [list of the available predefined Geant4 NIST material names](https://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/UsersGuides/ForApplicationDeveloper/html/Appendix/materialNames.html)
 * can be found in the corresponding part of the Geant4 Documentation.
 *
 * All thickness measured along the `x` axes while the `yz` extent is the same
 * both for the `absorber` and `gap` determined by the `fCaloSizeYZ` which can
 * be set dynamically by `SetCaloSizeYZ(val)/GetCaloSizeYZ()`.
 *
 * A single layer is composed from the above `absorber` and `gap` while the entire
 * `calorimeter` is built up form the given number of identical `layer`s shifted
 * along the `x` axes. The `calorimeter` center, i.e. the [0,0,0] position of the
 * corresponding Box shape local coordinate, is at the global origin (i.e. no
 * translation nor rotation is applied). The entire calorimeter is placed inside
 * the `world` that is the limit of our simulation universe. The `layer`,
 * `calorimeter` and `world` is filled with vacuum (very low density hydrogen),
 * so only the `absorber` and the `gap` have non-vacuum like materials.
 *
 * The shape of all objects (`absorber`, `gap`, `layer`, `calorimeter`, `world`)
 * is `Box`. A box object is constructed for each in the constructor by setting
 * the appropriate name and material index fields. Their proper sizes are
 * calculated and updated automatically whenever one of the above setters,
 * affecting any of the thicknesses or sizes, is invoked.
 *
 * The geometry can also provide an apropriate initial `x` position for the
 * primary particles locating in between the `world` and the `calorimeter` on
 * the left hand side (`GetPrimaryXposition()`). The `x` position, where the
 * `calorimeter` starts on the left hand side, can also be obtained
 * (`GetCaloStartXposition()`). These method will always give an appropriate
 * value as the corresponding data are also updated dynamically whenever any of
 * the thicknesses or sizes are modified.
 *
 *
 * The geometry also provides a very simple "navigation" through its
 * `CalculateDistanceToOut(G4double*, G4double*, Box**, int*, int*)` method that determines:
 * - the (deepest) volume/box in which the given global `position` is located
 * - the index of the layer (only if the point is located inside the `calorimeter`)
 * - and the index of the absorber: 0 for the `absorber` and 1 for the `gap`
 *   (but only in case the point is inside the calorimeter)
 *
 * At the end, it returns:
 * - a large (1E+20 [mm]) value whenever the `position` and `direction` is such
 *   that the particle is about leaving the `calorimeter` (i.e. going to vacuum
 *   then would hit the boundary of the `world` at the end of that step)
 * - otherwise: the distance to the boundary of the volume in which the given
 *   `position` was located: from the given `position` along the given `direction`.
 *
 * Note, that this distance is computed by using the corresponding box/volume
 * method (namely `Box::DistanceToOut(G4double*,G4double*) const`) and the `box` object
 * in which the given `position` was located:
 * - distance to out is 0 if a given `position` is outside of that volume/box
 * - volume boundaries, closer to `position` than half of the
 *   `Box::kCarTolerance` (= 1E-9 [mm]), are ignored when the direction is pointing
 *   out, i.e. these positions are considered to be outside, leading to 0 distance
 *   to the volume boundary from inside. (see more on `inside`, `surface` and
 *   `outside` at the `Box` documentation)
 *
 * A small (e.g. 1E-6 [mm]) push along the current direction might be
 * applied in the steppers when the distance to out was found to be 0.
 *
 * This is because it's assumed, that the 0 distance is due to the employed simple
 * location calculation, that ignors the tolerance, instead of using an apropriate
 * navigator. Namely, the point was located in volume A. but it's actually on its
 * `surface`: closer than `Box::kCarTolerance`/2 to its boundary. Morover, the direction
 * is pointing toward to the next, volume B., that is just on the other side of
 * this boundary. This correctly gives 0 distance to the boundary of volume A as
 * actually the given step will be done in volume B. Therefore, the small push is
 * to overcome the volume boundary, i.e. to push the point to be on the other side
 * of the boundary between volume A and B. Then, the point is calulated to be in
 * volume B now when relocating and as the direction is pointing inside volume B,
 * the expected distance to the next boundary of volume B is computed.

  /**
    * Locates a point in the geometry and calculates the distance till the next boundary.
    *
    * This method is supposed to be called at the pre-step point of the simulation step
    * with the global pre-step ponit coordinates and actual direction in order to:
    * - determine the volume in which this simulation step will be done (and more importantly,
    *   the material as everything depends on that (at least))
    * - the distance to the boundary of that volume along the given diretion (as the material
    *   might change on the other side of that boundary)
    *
    * The pre-step point is supposed to be inside the `calorimeter` volume, i.e. either
    * - `inside`: deeper than `Box::kCarTolerance`/2 form any of its boundaries
    * -  on `surface`: closer to a boundary than `Box::kCarTolerance`/2
    * While the distance to the `calorimeter` volume boundary is > zero in the first case,
    * this depends on the actual direction in the second case:
    * - zero: when the direction is pointing outside of that boundary, i.e. particle is about
    *         leaving the volume
    * - positive: as the particle is about moving in the volume otherwise
    * These are true for all (and not only for the `calorimeter`) volumes!
    *
    * During the simulation, each primary track starts from the `calorimeter` volume
    * boundary with a direction that is pointing inside, i.e. ensured to be inside (on
    * `surface` but pointing in). All tracks are terminated when the particle is about leaving
    * the `calorimeter`, i.e. the particle is on `surface` and pointing out (as the step would
    * be done in the vaccum ending on the boundary of our `world`). Therefore, all step pints,
    * and secondary tracks created at some of these points, are also ensured to be inside the
    * `calorimeter` (as defined above).
    *
    * In order to achive the above, this method returns with a large (1E+20 [mm]) distance to
    * boundary whenever the particle is about leaving the `calorimeter`. The point (the step)
    * is located to be in the `world` volume (`layer` and `absorber` indices are set to -1).
    * Otherwise, the point is located, i.e. the deepest volume inside the `calorimeter` in which
    * the point is located, is determined, the `layer` and `absorber` indices are set.
    *
    * However, this is done based on a simply computation of the `layer` index (based on its
    * thickness) then the same within the layer. In other words, this is done without considering
    * the tolerance or the direction (unlike in Geant4, having a robust but complex navigator for this).
    * Therefore, it might be the case that the point is calculated to be inside a given volume but
    * actually it's on the `surface` while moving out. The corresponding simulation step should actually
    * be performed in the next volume (that is just on the other side of that boundary). This is detected
    * during the simulation step computation, as this method returns zero distance in this case, and:
    * - a small push of 1E-6 [mm] is applied along the current direction (just to push the point to
    *   the other side of the boundary)
    * - this method is called again with the new position: calculated to be in the good volume now
    *
    * The input position, given in global coordinates, always transformed to the local system of the given
    * volume. This is an identity transformation for the `calorimeter` (as not translated nor rotated).
    * Then for the `layer`, the translation vector (having non-zero only its x-component) is determined
    * based on the first layer x-position (where the `calorimeter` starts), the thickness of the
    * `layer` and the current x-position of the point. After transforming the point to `layer` local
    * coordinates, the position is transformed further either to `absorber` or `gap` local coorinates
    * depending on which the point was calculated to be in.
    * At the end, the input position vector contains the position of the point in the local system of the
    * volume/shape that the pint was calculated to be located. Therefore, this local coorinates can be
    * used later directly in any shape (Box) methods, e.g. for computing the safety.
