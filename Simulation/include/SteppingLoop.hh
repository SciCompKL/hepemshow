 *
 * @brief Stepping loops for simulating \f$e^-\f$, \f$e^+\f$ and \f$\gamma\f$
 *        particle histories.
 *
 * The stepping loops can calculate a given \f$\gamma\f$ or \f$e^-/e^+\f$ particle
 * simulation history from their initial state till the end in a step-by-step way
 * (by the `SteppingLoop::GammaStepper(G4HepEmTLData&, G4HepEmState&, TrackStack&,
 * Geometry&, Results&, int)` and `SteppingLoop::ElectronStepper(G4HepEmTLData&,
 * G4HepEmState&, TrackStack&, Geometry&, Results&, int)` respectively). At each
 * step:
 * - the actual step length is calculated (accounting both the geometrical and
 *   the physics related constraints)
 * - the track is moved to its post-step position
 * - all physics related actions, happening along and/or at the post-step point,
 *   are performed on the track
 * - secondary tracks, generated in the given step by a physics interaction (if
 *   any), are insterted into the track stack (by calling the
 *   `SteppingLoop::StackSecondaries(G4HepEmTLData&, TrackStack&, G4HepEmTrack&)`
 *   method)
 * - information (e.g. energy deposit) might be collected at the end of each
 *   simulation step (by calling the `SteppingLoop::SteppingAction(Results&,
 *   const G4HepEmTrack&, const Box*, G4double, int, int, int, int)` method )
 *
 * **A bit more details**:
 *
 * A simulation history is terminated when:
 * - the particle kinetic energy becomes zero (e.g. an \f$e^-\f$ lost all its
 *   kinetic energy along its last step)
 * - the particle participated in a destructive interaction (e.g. photoelectric
 *   absorption of a \f$\gamma\f$ photon or conversion to \f$e^-/e^+\f$ pairs)
 * - the particle leaves the calorimeter (in a normal `Geant4` simulation the
 *   the history is terminated when the particle leaves the world)
 *
 * The physics related step length constraints as well as the actions (including
 * the secondary track production) are provided by the `G4HepEm` implementation
 * of the EM physics simulation.
 *
 * `G4HepEm` implements two top level methods, in its Gamma and Electron managers:
 * - to provide the information on `HowFar` a given input \f$\gamma\f$ or \f$e^-/e^+\f$
 *   track goes according to their physics related constraints (e.g. till their next
 *   physics interaction takes place or due to other physics related constraints).
 * - to `Perform` all necessary physics related updates on the given input
 *   \f$\gamma\f$ or \f$e^-/e^+\f$ track and produce all secondary tracks in the
 *   given physics interaction (if any).
 *
 * The first (`HowFar`) is invoked at the pre-step point while the second (`Perform`)
 * is at the post-step point of each individual simulation step computation inside
 * the `SteppingLoop::GammaStepper()` and `SteppingLoop::ElectronStepper()`.

 * In `G4HepEm` it's the `G4HepEmTLData` (thread local data) that is used in the
 * top level, two sided communication between the consumer and `G4HepEm`. It
 * encapsulates the (primary and secondary) tracks and the random number generator
 * dedicated for one particular thread. Its **primary** Gamma/Electron track field
 * is used to store the actual state of the \f$\gamma\f$ or \f$e^-/e^+\f$ track
 * that is under tracking. The step limit, imposed by all physics related constraints
 * on the actual track, is calculated at each pre-step point by calling the
 * bove-mentioned `HowFar` top level method provided by `G4HepEm`. Then the `Perform`
 * method needs to be invoked at the post-step point that performs all necessary
 * physics related updates on the input **primary** track while produces all
 * **scondary** tracks related to the given physics interaction (if any). The
 * secondary tracks are delivered back to the caller in the appropriate **seondary**
 * track fields of the `G4HepEmTLData` object.
 *
 * We might provide more details on how a \f$\gamma\f$ and \f$e^-/e^+\f$ simulation
 * step is computed but you might find some information by inspecting the
 * implementations of the top level `HowFar` and `Perform` `G4HepEm` methods
 * in the corresponding `G4HepEmGammaManager/G4HepEmElectronManager`.
