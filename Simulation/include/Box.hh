 *
 * @brief A simplified version of the G4Box shape.
 *
 * This is a simple version of the G4Box shape to describe geometry objects and
 * use them in the simulation to calculate distance to their boundary from a
 * point inside. Note, that the calculations include a tolerance, e.g. a point
 * is on the surface if closer to a boundary than 1/2 tolerance (kCarTolerance).
 * The two most important methods, used during this simplified simulation, are:
 *
 * - DistanceToOut(position, direction): distance to boundary from a local
 *     position (inside the box) along the given direction. The boundary is
 *     ignored if the position is closer to it than 1/2 tolerance (i.e. point is
 *     on the surface). The distance to boundary is zero in this case whenever
 *     the direction is pointing outisde (i.e. the particle is moving away/out).
 *
 * - DistanceToOut(postition): this is the `safety`, i.e. the distance to the
 *     nearest boundary from the given local point inside (zero if on the surface
 *     or outside).
 *
 * This version of the Box stores an index to the material that fills the shape
 * (therefore closer to the Geant4 `logical` volume concept than to a shape).
 *
 * Box shapes are constructed for each geometry object in the `Geometry` and
 * the above methods are utilised during the simulation step computation in the
 * `GammaStepper` and `ElectronStepper` (in some case indirectly by calling
 * `Geometry::DistanceToOut` that first locates the point, i.e. finds the Box
 * object which the given global point is located in).
 *
 * NOTE: a point given in local coordiantes can locate
 *  - `inside`  : if deeper inside than `kCarTolerance/2` from any boundary
 *  - `surface` : if within `kCarTolerance/2` from any boundary (in- or outside)
 *  - `outside` : if further away than `kCarTolerance/2` from any boundary outside
 *
 * NOTE: distance to volume boundary from a point along a given direction is
 *  zero when the point is not `inside` and the direction is pointing away.
 *  Therefore, a point located on the surface gives distance to boundary:
 *  - zero    : if the direction is pointing outside of that boundary
 *  - non-zero: if the direction is pointing inside of that boundary
